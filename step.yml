description: |-
  This Step runs a specified workflow from the targeted bitrise.yml file.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the Workflow ID. The Workflow ID input uses the $BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID environment variable by default. This environment variable is automatically set to the workflow that triggered the build.
  2. Set the bitrise.yml path. It's populated with the "./bitrise.yml" path by default.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Please make sure that you select an existing Workflow ID.
  Please make sure that you set a correct and existing bitrise.yml file path.
