  This Step runs a specified Workflow from the targeted `bitrise.yml` file.

  ### Configuring the Step

  1. Set the **Workflow ID** input. It uses the `$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID` Environment Variable (Env Var) by default. This Env Var is automatically set to the Workflow that triggered the build.
  2. Set the **bitrise.yml path**. It's populated with `./bitrise.yml` path by default.

  ### Troubleshooting
  Please make sure that you select an existing Workflow ID.
  Please make sure that you set a correct and existing `bitrise.yml` file path.
